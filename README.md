# Recommendations
Analysis of these customers who have less chance of being defaulters with the profit of the firm 
As these are non defaulters , we need to approve a loan of higher amount for them , as they have  high chance of repaying the loan amount.
There are 6250  customers those who have low probability of being defaulter . And they have applied for credit amount between 5 lakh and 6 lakh . By approving this , the firm will  get business profit as these applicants  will be repaying the credit on time  than loss of the firm .
